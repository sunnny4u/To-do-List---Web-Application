In this application everything works fine but the contact page.
In contact page if you click on submit button it will show this "(535, b'5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at\n5.7.8  https://support.google.com/mail/?p=BadCredentials p19sm16122547pfn.99 - gsmtp')" -Error.
Because no email is provided here to send message.

To Make submit button work watch this youtube tutorial:
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpTrmDpadZY"
It will help you with the contact page.
Or you can search on google or youtube using this tag "sending email in django".

Thank you..!
